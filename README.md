## About Dots & Boxes
- Dots and Boxes is a classic game played with pen and paper for two players or more(in our game it is only two players).
- It starts with empty dotted-grid and it will be filled with lines and boxes by the players.
- Player 1 is always the one that starts first by default.
- The players takes turn to connect the dots by either vertical or horizontal lines.
- A box is filled once a player compelets all the lines around it.
- The player that compelets a box earns a point and he gets a bonus turn.
- The game ends once all boxes have been filled and the player with the highest score wins.
- If two players has the same score it is a tie.
